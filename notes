Starship app with SWAPI - SSStarwars or SWStarships

1. Greet the user, tell them what the program does. (load data from API before greeting)

2. print out (puts) all the starships available with a number order. if they only show a select few on one page, create a next list to go to the next page of startships until all are gone through.

3. create a go_back method to return to a previous page and before that until it reaches the first page.

4. iterate over the hash to display multiple ships and have a user pick one to see more of the information.

5. collect and display information of selected ship for them to learn more about it the ship they choose.

6. add commands to go back to the list of ships or to return to first page of ships so they can choose another ship.


Classes for CLI:

API class - retireve an manipulate the data from the API

CLI class- interaction with the user and running the application

Starship class: stores data of each starship object and holds it to display when user makes an input later.
