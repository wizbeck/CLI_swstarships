Starship app with SWAPI - SSStarwars or SWStarships

- Greet the user, tell them what the program does. (load data from API before greeting)
- print out/puts all the starships available with a number order. if they only show a select few on one page, create a next list to go to the next page of starships until all are gone through.
- iterate over the hash of api data and instantiate multiple ship objects and store them in the starship class array.
- collect and display information (using attr_accessors) of selected ship for user to learn more about the ship they choose.
- add commands to go back to the list of ships or to return to the main menu to choose another ship.
